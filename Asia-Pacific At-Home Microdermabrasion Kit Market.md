Traditionally, men have not been as focused on skincare routines as women, but attitudes are changing as more men seek solutions for improving skin texture and combating skin issues like acne scars, ingrown hairs, and signs of aging. As awareness around the importance of skin health continues to rise, more men are integrating microdermabrasion into their personal care regimes.
